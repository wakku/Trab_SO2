**************************** THE AWESOME SHELL ******************************

Code Organization:

	The code is divided in two files:
		- main.c
		- config.h

	The config.h contains the defined variables, such as the maximum size of the command line, and two functions: (1) the one used to find the path the user is at, and (2) the help function, which gives some explanation of how to use The Awesome Shell.

	Meanwhile, the main.c file contains the main structure of the shell, having in the main function the prompt loop, in which the shell is always ready to receive a new command line, and defining if there is an input file or an output file. 
	If there is and input and/or output file, the prompt look call the exec_external function, which is responsible for opening and/or reading or writing and saving the input and/or output file, respectively.
	Furthermore, there is the exec_builtin function, which recognizes the basic function that have to be implemented by our shell and executes it.
